# DrawFolder

This is a project for the Mobile Computing Course at IxD, Chalmers, 2020.

We are group 19.

Project website: https://mouse-piccolo-d25a.squarespace.com (private but teacher should be able to access)


The website contains the full design. This implementation is a representation of the main parts of the design:
- revealing private files by drawing a pattern
- opening files and editing them
- the flow of setting the user pattern

Many things are incomplete. Others, we couldn't figure out technically. Therefore we have imposed some limitations on the interactions possible:
- it is not currently possible to create a file, only to edit the example files created by the app
- patterns cannot really be set by users: we have pre-defined two patterns which reveal two different sets of files:

- accounts and settings pages are limited in functionality


## How to run the project
1. Have Android Studio installed
2. Open the project as an Android Studio project
3. Select device and run (if on physical device, please enable USB Debugging on your phone)

We have tested the project on a Pixel 2 emulator, running Android 9.0 (API 28), and on a OnePlus 6.
