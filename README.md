# DrawFolder

This is a project for the Mobile Computing Course at IxD, Chalmers, 2020.

We are group 19.

Project website: https://mouse-piccolo-d25a.squarespace.com (private but teacher should be able to access)


The website contains the full design. This implementation is a representation of the main parts of the design:
- revealing private files by drawing a pattern
- opening files and editing them
- the flow of setting the user pattern

Many things are incomplete. Others, we couldn't figure out technically. Therefore we have imposed some limitations on the interactions possible:
- it is not currently possible to create a file, only to edit the example files created by the app
- patterns cannot really be set by users: we have pre-defined two patterns which reveal two different sets of files:

- accounts and settings pages are limited in functionality
